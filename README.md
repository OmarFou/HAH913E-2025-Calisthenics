Final Project - HAH913E Physical activity for health

# Calisthenics Activity Analysis with Accelerometer Data

This project aims to analyze physical activity using accelerometer data in order to build a digital tool that helps users improve their training technique.  
Our focus is on four calisthenics exercises: **pull-ups, dips and push-ups**.

The work demonstrates the complete physical activity analysis pipeline:
- data collection using an accelerometer sensor,
- preprocessing and cleaning,
- segmentation of repetitions,
- feature extraction,
- visualization and interpretation,
- automated evaluation of exercise performance.
