# Notebooks Directory

This folder contains all the Jupyter notebooks used during the development of the project.

The notebooks are **workspaces** where data exploration, preprocessing, visualization, and methodology testing were performed.

## Contents

- **pullups_dips.ipynb**  
  Contains the analysis pipeline for pull-ups and dips using accelerometer data.

- **pushups.ipynb**  
  Contains the analysis pipeline for push-ups and biceps curls using accelerometer data.

## Purpose

These notebooks are **not** the final version of the project.  
They contain experiments, tests, and intermediate steps used to build the final demo (`main.ipynb`).
